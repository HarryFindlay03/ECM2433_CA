From the above data, to achieve a good shuffle on array of length 50, it does not really matter how many times you riffle it.

This is true as after 7 shuffles, and 15 shuffles, the shuffle quality is 0.51.

However, after 9 shuffles and 3 shuffles the quality is 0.38 and 0.41 respectively.

I have ran this a few times, and each run gives me similar results, so the more you riffle a deck of cards, it does not affect the overall quality of the shuffle.
